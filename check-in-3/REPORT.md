# Part 3

## Check-In 3

The finish line is in sight! You should have your data in hand and some models made. This portion of the Capstone contains two parts to help really hone your model and develop mastery over your final project.

*Goal*: A written progress report on your project and a detailed 1:1 with your instructor.

---

## Problem Statement

The focus of this capstone is on reinforcement learning and applying it to a simulated environment.  

The work has been broken down into two portions
- learning about Reinforcement Learning Models and generating a working model
- generating a simulation with PyGame

Note that normal EDA is less of a concern.  The data is generated by an artificial environment and does not require much cleaning.  The issue instead is refining the simulation/game.

## Progress
Main objectives 
* Working Reinforcement Learning Model
* Developing simple simulation with PyGame

### Completed
* Kaggle tutorials on Reinforcement Learning
    * These focused on exercises for States, Actions, Rewards, and Policies
    * More of a deterministic approach - the neural network had nodes for every single possible outcome
    * Problems: 
        * Notebooks had module compatibility issues and could not be run
    
* Have identified and run simple TensorFlow Deep Q Learning tutorials/exercises
    * Uses latest tensorflow versions, open ai, tf-agents
    * Have run reinforcement learning for TicTacToe, Colab cart-pole demo
* Working version of simple PyGame has been copied from tutorials as a basis for problems 
* Found a video on Reinforcement Learning which uses text output captured as a PIL image
    * this is a financial simulation app which seeks to maximize on investments
* Able to render/capture PyGame images for model to learn from, but need to integrate the controls through the environment
* Most of the reinforcement learning, can read images that translate

## In progress

* Adapting OpenAI Environment class to handle PyGame Rendering with TensorFlow
* Define States/Actions to maximize learning
  * Overall, the emphasis of the project is on Reinforcement Learning vs. the actual "game" used to maximize results
    That said the data is probably what will make it more appealing to people than the actual work done to generate the model
  * There are already working examples of Reinforcement Learning with Super Mario and other games, but that is not that interesting
* Developing Simulation

## Topic changes

* Initial thesis had been to use multi-agents in a simulation similar to Game Of Life
   * Moving away from Game of Life to something that has more agency and choices
   * Looking more at an explicit game or app where outcome can be maximized
     * Mainly looking for a game with simple rules and heuristics as opposed to covering every single situation
     * More of a survival simulation/game with agents capable of different (simple) behaviors
   * Had wanted something with more continuous learning where learning could be shared apdaptively among agents
      * Still an interesting problem, but am settling for just training a Reinforcement Learning model to just learn a game
    
## Timeline this week
* Get simple OpenAI environment working
* Get Reinforcement Learning model to run with simple PyGame 
* Work on defining simple State+Actions, Policies, Rewards and Action Critiques

* Overall timeline - have a working demo by Capstone presentation
   * I figure it won't be flashy but more proof of concept
    * The ideal would be to have something that can adapt to maximize operation of a tool

7. What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?

We will use your progress report as a leaping off point for a deep 1:1 with a member of the instructional staff. The best use of your time is to really flesh out this document so that your remaining time here can be most productive.

The deadline for this deliverable can be found on the `course-info` page.

## EDA

Because this is about working with a simulation/game, this isn't as much about collecting data

The EDA is in developing the simulation.



## Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Your progress report (touching on the points above) submitted to your instructor.
